       <p class="lead">My name is Sara Silverman, and I am currently a sophomore Journalism major and Law and society minor at the University of Maryland. I am also a part of the University Honors College. I am driven, hard-working, and passionate in journalism, law, and public relations. In high school, I truly enjoyed taking on leadership roles that focused on community service and mentoring younger women. As a freshman and sophomore, I have involved myself with campus publications like The Campus Trainer and the Mitzpeh, as well as being a tutor for The Every Child Project.</p>

            <h3>Problem solver:</h3>
            I have learned to problem solve as an assistant head counselor for Camp Seafarer where I worked last summer for 11 weeks. I demonstrated my ability to deal with any camper problems or concerns, communicate with my staff about more serious camper problems, and positively interact with the campers daily as a person that they can look up to and trust.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3>Communicative:</h3>
            I have practiced and improved my communicative skills through working as a staff writer for The Campus Trainer and the Mitzpeh. I express my thoughts clearly and make sure others understand my perspective. I also listen carefully and respond thoughtfully, which helps create open and productive conversations where people feel heard and valued.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3>Organizational:</h3>
            I have immense experience with organizing events and handling communication through my job this summer as assistant division leader for a unit at my sleepaway camp. In addition, throughout high school I was the president of two community service clubs. Both of these clubs were based on organizing events to help students become active in community service. I created a service assembly for the whole high school and reached out to multiple outside organizations and communicated with them and the school to create this event.
