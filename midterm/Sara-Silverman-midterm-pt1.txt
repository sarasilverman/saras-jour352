2.  Describe the purpose of a DIV tag.

A DIV is a container created by the <div> tag. Its main purpose is to group and organize content. The DIV alone does not apply any styling, however, when paired with CSS code, writing a DIV allows one to target the content within a DIV to style content.


3.  Write out the basic structure of an HTML page, putting the basic tags in the correct position.  (Note: you don't need to connect it to a stylesheet or include DIV tags or anything like that).

<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            Basic HTML page 
        </title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>heading</h1>
        <p> first paragraph of basic HTML page </p>
    </body>
    </html>


4.  There are two main "areas" or "sections" in the basic structure of an HTML page. In which area would you put a link to a stylesheet?

The two main areas are the "head" and the "body". A link to a stylesheet goes in the "head".

10.  Why do we use media queries?

They are the key to responsive design. Media queries are a type of CSS that allows one to change the style of an element to accommodate and adjust to different screen sizes. It is really important as many people access websites or apps from not only a desktop screen but also a mobile device. Media queries are crucial for developers to make sure they are creating a design that is accessible across all platforms. 


11. What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?

The main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font is that serif fonts have small lines or flourishes at the end of each letter while sans-serif do not have those. This makes the serif fonts seem more formal while the sans-serif fonts are more modern looking and minimal.
